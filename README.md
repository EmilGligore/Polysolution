This was my thesis project for finishing university. I managed to get 9.5 out of 10 with it.

It is a full stack web application for managing private clinics.
It has the following functionalities: client information storage and retrieval, bed management, scheduling for operations, storage keeping, scheduling doctors for work.
There are three types of users: admin, management and doctor. Each have different things which they can do and see, for example the doctor can see when he has to work.
